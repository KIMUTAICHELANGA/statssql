SQL for Statistical Analysis README
Overview
This repository contains SQL scripts and resources for performing statistical analysis using SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is a powerful language commonly used for managing and analyzing relational databases. With the right queries and techniques, SQL can also be leveraged for statistical analysis of data stored in databases.

Prerequisites
To use the SQL scripts in this repository, you need:

Access to a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, or SQL Server.
Basic understanding of SQL syntax and database concepts.
A dataset or database containing the data you want to analyze statistically.
Usage
1. Connect to Database
Make sure you have access to the database containing your dataset. Use your preferred SQL client or command-line tool to connect to the database.

bash
Copy code
psql -U username -d database_name -h host -p port
2. Run SQL Queries
Browse the queries/ directory to find SQL scripts for various statistical analyses. Each script is named descriptively based on the analysis it performs.

sql
Copy code
-- Example: Run a script to calculate descriptive statistics
\i queries/descriptive_statistics.sql
3. Analyze Results
After running the SQL scripts, review the output to understand the statistical insights derived from your data. You may need to interpret the results further or visualize them using external tools like Python, R, or Excel.
